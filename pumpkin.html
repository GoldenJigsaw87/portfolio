    There is a house not far from here on county
road 9. In it lived an old man prized for his 
craftsmanship. Though some of his creations 
were a little more useful than others, his prize 
creation simply known as SAM, was his favorite. 
A mechanical clown that smelled like popcorn
he was a fan favorite across 3 counties
until one day just out of
nowhere SAM got a little too overworked
 and combusted into flames. The entire 
fair he was working at that day 
gone in moments and only few made it
from a night talked of for many years. As for the 
new machines he created from regret. It is said that they are 
in far worse condition compared to what they should have been 
man he left himself in that old house clinging to the past
He lost his life half a year later from a heart attack. 
can be heard crying out from within the machines.
But it is said that if you go into that house the mans voice
still echoes within the machines stored in that house.

    <h2>The basement</h2>
    <p>Inside that house's basement was the birthplace of SAM and all of the mans other
        creations. But the voice of a little girl can also be heard among those walls.
        The engineers daughter gone before her time but still remaining somehow. She 
        loved her fathers work and her father became ambitious for her. After the passing of
        his little girl his ambition became a rage that created monsters. Those monsters now the 
        only thing driving him until he got his composure back. Then the creation of SAM all for the memory
        of his daughter. After SAM burned down the depression returned back into that house
        no more wife, no more daughter, and no more creations for him to look back on fondly.

    <h2>The voice</h2>
    <div class="voice">
<p>
    This isn't the end of things this is simply the start of something far far worse. The darkness that 
    consumes you is only temporary versus what is coming. Be careful or you may not return from this.

    This was the voice the man was hearing at home. This was the voice that consumed him after SAM 
    this was his demon but it sounded just like his daughter. In his chaos he heard her voice more
    and it gave him the drive but that drive twisted him beyond all repair. At first it was helpful to him
    but after time it became a burden that drove him away. Missing his daughter the engineer worked until his final days.
    Those who know the tale know just how much that mans daughter meant to him. And the creations reflected
    just about where he was in his life.

<p>This project is from a website we did as a class where each of us submitted a story of sorts for a big halloween 
    project. Included is the story that I made for the project as well as my css and javascript files 
    used to make this project possible.
