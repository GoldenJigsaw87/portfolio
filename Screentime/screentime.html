    <p>This project is the grand project for us second years at Fort Hays Tech Northwest. We are building
        a screentime tracker app that also doubles as a competitive app for people to stay off their phones but you are
        also able to have friends that you can compete against. As of makeing this the design is all that we have for this
        as of right now.
