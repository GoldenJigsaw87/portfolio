<h3>Work Experiences</h3>
<p>I have a majority of retail experience however I have recently put time into fast food. As someone who tries to chase new things I have found that I had better time in retail but am excited to change that. In terms of school I have experience as the Vice President of the school robotics club and plan to become president next year. As of the start of year 2 I am a student of the 
    project managment pathway offered by the App Development and Emerging Tech course at Fort Hays Tech Northwest.</p>
